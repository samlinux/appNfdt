The Fabric developers have been working with network operators to deliver v1.4 with a focus on stability and production operations. As such, v1.4.x will be our first long term support release.Our policy to date has been to provide bug fix (patch) releases for our most recent major or minor release until the next major or minor release has been published. We plan to continue this policy for subsequent releases. However, for Hyperledger Fabric v1.4, the Fabric maintainers are pledging to provide bug fixes for a period of one year from the date of release. This will likely result in a series of patch releases (v1.4.1, v1.4.2, and so on), where multiple fixes are bundled into a patch release.If you are running with Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.x, you can be assured that you will be able to safely upgrade to any of the subsequent patch releases. In the advent that there is need of some upgrade process to remedy a defect, we will provide that process with the patch release."
